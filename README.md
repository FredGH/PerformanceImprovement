## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

Your challenge, if you wish to accept it (and we sure hope you will), is to optimize this online portfolio for speed! In particular, optimize the critical rendering path and make this page render as quickly as possible by applying the techniques you've picked up in the [Critical Rendering Path course](https://www.udacity.com/course/ud884).

To get started, check out the repository, inspect the code,

https://github.com/micyang/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio
### Getting started

There are two parts to this project.

Part 1: The original project PageSpeed scores the index.html at 67% is for  mobile and 97%. The aim is to increase the score to at least 90% on both decide after fixing.

Part 2: In its original incarnation the file "views/pizza.html" was not optimized for 60fps (views/pizza.html). The aim is to optimize it to 60fps.

####Set-up

1. Check out the repository
1. To inspect the site on your phone, you can run a local server

  ```bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080
  ```

1. Open a browser and visit localhost:8080
1. Download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to make your local server accessible remotely.

  ``` bash
  $> cd /path/to/your-project-folder
  $> ngrok 8080
  ```

####Part 1: Optimize PageSpeed Insights score for index.html

Methodology:
1. Open the PageSpeed site: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fudacity%2Ffrontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio%2Findex.html&tab=mobile
2. Scan this  https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-mobile-portfolio/index.html
3. Follow the instructions relating to improvements

Improvement list:
1. Set the view port to the width of the device, to scale it down to the device size.
Not directly related to performance, but it makes sense to fix
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width">
2. Remove the following tags and replace by their inline equivalent
<link href="css/style.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="css/print.css" rel="stylesheet">
3. addition of the 'async' to as this js dos not contain css modification
therefore it can be run in parallel.
<script async src="http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script>
4. I used http://compressjpeg.com/ to compressed all jpg images.
This reduce the picture foot print by a factor of 4 on average.
5. I used http://www.willpeavy.com/minifier/ to minify the html


1. Copy the public URL ngrok gives you and try running it through PageSpeed Insights! Optional: [More on integrating ngrok, Grunt and PageSpeed.](http://www.jamescryer.com/2014/06/12/grunt-pagespeed-and-ngrok-locally-testing/)

Profile, optimize, measure... and then lather, rinse, and repeat. Good luck!

####Part 2: Optimize Frames per Second in pizza.html

To optimize views/pizza.html, you will need to modify views/js/main.js until your frames per second rate is 60 fps or higher. You will find instructive comments in main.js. 

You might find the FPS Counter/HUD Display useful in Chrome developer tools described here: [Chrome Dev Tools tips-and-tricks](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/tips-and-tricks).

### Customization with Bootstrap
The portfolio was built on Twitter's <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework. All custom styles are in `dist/css/portfolio.css` in the portfolio repo.
